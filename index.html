        <h2> 🙋‍♂️About Me</h2>
        <p>
           <br> 🚀 Data Scientist | Machine Learning & Cloud Enthusiast <br>
            
            <br>Hi, I’m Mustaaq Ahmed Khan, a driven and detail-oriented Graduate Student pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at the University of Bridgeport. With a strong passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights, I specialize in leveraging cutting-edge tools and technologies to solve complex real-world challenges. My expertise spans programming languages like Python, SQL, R, and C++, as well as frameworks such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, and XGBoost, enabling me to build robust machine learning models and deliver impactful solutions. <br>
            
            <br>As a Data Science Intern at Delta Sigma Technologies , I optimized data processing workflows, reducing processing time by 90% through efficient algorithms and parallel computing. I analyzed over 500K data points weekly to enhance predictive analytics models, improving decision-making processes by 30% and delivering findings with 90% accuracy. This experience honed my ability to translate data-driven insights into tangible business outcomes.<br>
            <br>I recently completed a Virtual Data Analyst Internship Certification from Trainity , where I worked on diverse projects such as Instagram User Analytics, Operational & Metric Analytics, Hiring Process Analytics, IMDB Movie Analysis, Bank Loan Case Studies, Impact of Car Features, and ABC Call Volume Trends. These projects strengthened my proficiency in Excel, SQL, Python, Power BI, and Tableau while sharpening my skills in exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and deriving actionable business insights. Through this certification, I developed a keen eye for identifying patterns, optimizing workflows, and creating scalable solutions that drive efficiency and accuracy in data-driven decision-making.<br>
            
            <br>I am currently exploring Azure ML and MLOps , preparing for the DP-100 certification , with the goal of bridging the gap between machine learning development and deployment. My ultimate aspiration is to leverage data science and AI to drive strategic decision-making in high-stakes environments, such as Formula 1 strategy engineering, where precision and speed are paramount. <br> 
        <br>With a solid foundation in data analytics , cloud computing , and machine learning , coupled with hands-on experience in tools like Power BI, Tableau, and Excel, I am excited to push the boundaries of what’s possible with data. I thrive on solving real-world problems through innovative approaches and am eager to contribute to transformative projects that harness the power of AI and data science. 🌟<br>
        <br>Let’s connect and explore how we can turn data into decisions! 🚀<br> </p>
